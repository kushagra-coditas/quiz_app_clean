  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the

  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the // ignore: name_of_lint and
  # // ignore_for_file: name_of_lint syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
